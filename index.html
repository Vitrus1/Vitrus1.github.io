	<h1>This web page will be dedicated to the build of my 1993 2.8l GMC Sonoma</h1>
	<p>In July of 2014 I bought my self a 1993 GMC Sonoma in rough condition with the intention of fixing it up. </p>
	<p> This is going to be a step by step process updated regularly of what I get done with it and tips for others going down the same path as me.</p>

	<p>I bought the truck for $1000 and it ran strong but had a little more then a lot of rust... The quarter panel wheel wells were beyond repairable but I tried to fix them and failed so I ended up buying a new box. The cab corners on both side and as well the rocker panels are just eaten away. The driver side quarter panel was rusted through so that has been replaced. When it comes to rust repair I have learned it is much easier to buy a replacement part and weld it into place rather then try to bondo it and have it crack. Now earlier I had said when I bought the truck it ran great... Well as the colder weather approached it seems it no longer wants to run as great as it did any more, it wont start unless you give it gas and hold it for a few seconds and when it starts for the first 5-10 minutes it idles terribly, low RPMS and shaky as can be. That's a problem for another day though, right now my main focus is the rust repair and body work.
	<p>Right now I have gotten about 80% of the rust off of the truck which for the most part came from the old box. I have started to sand and prime the box and so far it has actually came out looking good, There will be photos to follow as soon as I can get a higher quality camera to take photos with.
